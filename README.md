# Deploy preview environment using preevy

## About Preevy

Preevy is a powerful CLI tool designed to simplify the process of creating ephemeral preview environments.
Using Preevy, you can easily provision any [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) application using any Kubernetes server or affordable VMs on [AWS Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/free/compute/lightsail), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/) or [Azure VM](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/virtual-machines/).

## About the preevy-down action

Use this action to delete a preview environment using the Preevy CLI whenever a PR is merged or closed. More information about running Preevy from CI [over here](https://preevy.dev/ci).

Preevy's [GitHub plugin](https://preevy.dev/github-plugin) will automatically update the comment generated by the "up" workflow to indicate the environment was deleted.

See the [preevy-up action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/preevy-up) for more information and examples.

## Permissions

Preevy requires the following [GitHub Actions permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs):

* `contents: read`: used by Preevy to read the Docker Compose file(s)
* `pull-requests: write`: used by the Preevy GitHub plugin to write or update a comment on the PR

In addition, if you're using GitHub's OIDC Token endpoint to authenticate to your cloud provider (as in the below examples), `id-token: write`: is also needed.

## Inputs

### `profile-url`

*required*: `true`

The profile url created by the CLI, [as detailed in the docs](https://preevy.dev/ci/).

### `args`

*required*: `false`

Optional additional args to the `preevy down` command. [Full reference](https://preevy.dev/cli-reference/down).

### `version`

*required*: `false`

The preevy [CLI version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preevy?activeTab=versions) to use. Defaults to `latest`.

***Note*** Since `v1.3.0`, this action requires Preevy CLI version `v0.0.58` or newer. To use an older version of the CLI, use `livecycle/preevy-down-action@v1.2.0`.

### `docker-compose-yaml-paths`

*required*: `false`

Optional path to the `docker-compose.yaml` file. If not provided, uses the working directory. If you have multiple docker compose files, you can add them as a comma seperated string like so `'docker-compose.yml,docker-compose.dev.yml'`

### `install`

*required*: `false`

***EXPERIMENTAL***. Installation method for the Preevy CLI. Specify `gh-release` to install Preevy from a binary file, which is much faster than using NPM. Specify `none` to skip the installation steps. The default is `npm` which will install from NPM.

If `gh-release` is specified, `version` can be either `latest` or one of the [released versions](https://github.com/livecycle/preevy/releases). Canary versions are not supported.

### `node-cache`

*required*: `false`

Node package manager used for caching. Supported values: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or ''. [Details](https://github.com/actions/setup-node/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#caching-packages-data). Default: `npm`.

### `working-directory`

*required*: `false`

Specifies the working directory where the Preevy CLI is run
